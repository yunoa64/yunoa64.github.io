  abstract = {Alternative (alt) text is essential for people with visual impairments to acquire information about image content through a screen reader. However, collecting images and creating alt text requires time and effort. To deal with this problem, automatically collecting images that have no alt text is essential to ensure that all image content in a web page has their alt text. Additionally, automatic alt text has limitations in accuracy and quality compared to human-created alt text despite the improvements in image recognition and natural language process technology. We present WATAA, a web alt text authoring assistant that collects images containing no alt text and suggests automatic alt text to help human alt text authors improve a web page’s accessibility.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) gives many benefits to our lives. However, biased AI models created by receiving data poisoning attacks may induce social problems. Therefore, developers must consider carefully whether the training data received a poison attack when developing an AI model. Data visualization is one of the methods to facilitate the analysis of the data required for checking if the training data received a poisoning attack. However, prior studies did not visualize real-world AI training data. Restaurant reviews in delivery apps are one of the cases of a poisoned dataset. Restaurants hold review events on delivery apps to encourage customers to write a positive review in return for certain rewards, thereby creating reviews with bias. In this study, we propose POisoned Real-world Data Explainer (PORDE) that explains data poisoning attacks through visual analytics with food delivery app reviews. The findings of this study suggest implications for securing safe training data and developing less biased AI models.},

  abstract={Food image classification is useful in diet management apps for personal health management. Various methods for classifying food images in a particular country have been proposed in multiple studies. However, knowledge of Korean food image classification is limited. The objective of this study was to train a classification model for Korean food images. To train the classification model, we collected Korean food images from the AI-Hub platform, a public food image dataset. The images were pre-processed and augmented for model training. The proposed model was evaluated in an experiment using a Korean food image dataset and effectively classified Korean food images based on transfer learning. The findings of the study revealed that the model’s performance in classifying food images depended on the type of food. The findings have implications for the classification model training process using CNN and the Korean public food image dataset. Future work is required to improve the performance of a classification model, especially as it pertains to its poor performance for some food image types.},
